ScopusSearch
============

This is a class to enable you to perform a query and then retrieve the records of the query for analysis.  The EIDs for the search are cached so subsequent analysis is quicker.  This class mostly just provides a list of EIDs which you can use for the :doc:`ScopusAbstract <./scopus_api>` class.
